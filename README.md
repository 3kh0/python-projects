# 3kh0's Python Scripts

This is a short collection of Python scripts I made, they do random stuff, and each has a folder. I will keep them well documented with a README for everything.

## How to run these

Here is a guide if you have never run a Python file and do not know how.

### Install Python

Before you can run Python scripts, you must install Python on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Please download the script you want to run. You can use [this tool](https://download-directory.github.io/) to only download one folder.

### Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

- **On Windows:**
    - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
    - Type `cmd` or `powershell` and press Enter.

- **On macOS or Linux:**
    - Open the terminal through your preferred method.

### Navigate to the Script's Directory

Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example:

```bash
cd path/to/your/script
```

### Run the Script

Once you're in the correct directory, run the script using the `python` command:

```bash
python coolscript.py
```

If you're using Python 3, you might need to use `python3`:

```bash
python3 coolscript.py
```

### It did not work!

- Ensure that Python is in your system's PATH so that you can run it from any directory.
- If you have issues, please ensure your Python installation is successful and the PATH variable is set correctly.
- If you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, you can often run scripts directly from the IDE.
